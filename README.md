# PixelCNN & PixelRNN in TensorFlow
TensorFlow implementation of [Pixel Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759). 
Thanks for Taehoon Kim / [@carpedm20](http://carpedm20.github.io/) and my code is based on his code.This implementation adds mask convolution and cifar10 dataset script and row lstm is processing.
